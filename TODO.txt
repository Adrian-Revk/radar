Important :
x Index rendering instead of vertex rendering
x Sphere mesh
x Per-object material (texture ? uniform ?) --> start with uniform buffer per-obj for ease
x Freefly Camera
x Default Texture in Render::
x Specular textures
x Normal textures
x Area light
    x Diffuse
    x Specular
o GT area light lighting

Normal :
x GGX -- fixed (smith DFG + burley's disney diffuse)
x Assimp models
o ImGUI
o Prefiltered cubemap for ambient specular
o Envmaps (cubemaps)
o Directional light
o Use quaternions instead of vec3 for rotation info
o Light aggregation work could be done at SceneUpdate instead of SceneRender
    - Also, could be done lazily only if light configuration changed, if not just send the same UBO

Less :
x Shader Hot reload
o Material Resources & Manager to avoid having duplicated materials and allow per-material sorting
o Visualisation for light sources
    o point lights (debug object)
    x area lights (real geometry)
o have the Makefile recompile if .h or .inl changed
