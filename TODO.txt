Important :
x Index rendering instead of vertex rendering
x Sphere mesh
x Per-object material (texture ? uniform ?) --> start with uniform buffer per-obj for ease
o Freefly Camera

Normal :
x GGX -- fixed (smith DFG + burley's disney diffuse)
o ImGUI
o Prefiltered cubemap for ambient specular
o Assimp models

Less :
o Material Resources & Manager to avoid having duplicated materials and allow per-material sorting
