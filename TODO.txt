Important :
x Index rendering instead of vertex rendering
x Sphere mesh
x Per-object material (texture ? uniform ?) --> start with uniform buffer per-obj for ease
x Freefly Camera
x Default Texture in Render::
x Specular textures
x Normal textures
x Area light
    x Diffuse
    x Specular (LTC)
x GT area light lighting
o Fix GT area light
o Have a way to update buffers (specially vbos), instead of recreating them. Buffers should be allocated at 
	program start and destroyed at the end.
o 2D stuff. Test having way to make a fractal (burning boat)

Normal :
x GGX -- fixed (smith DFG + burley's disney diffuse)
x Assimp models
x ImGUI
x RTT
x GBuffer
	x First buffer pass
x SH Visualisation
	x SH Visualisation mesh creation
	x SH Visualisation Render (shader + Scene code)
		x Render as object
		x Separate SHVis scene struct (unique one depicting mouse click pos or smthg), 1 created, gets updated by mouse click
x Modify the Mouse SH Vis with real SH integration data
x WS arealight SH
o Unit arealight SH
o LTC arealight SH
o LTC arealight ZH (ZHF)
x Mouse Object Picking (from gbuffer objectID)
x Mouse Vertex Picking
x Envmaps (cubemaps)
	o EXR image loading
    o HDR Envmaps
o Directional light
o Scene Hierarchy (BVH, Octree/kdTree ?)
	o Sphere hierarchy
		x per-obj sphere position/radius
	o Convex Hull hierarchy ?
x A Precomputed RandomValues Pool that takes a functor in entry to generate rand values according to that func
	e.g. PrecomputedRandomPool pool1(std::sqrt, 1024) create a pool of 1024 square root values
x Radar Lib shouldnt load data itself ? Because of paths ?

Less :
x Shader Hot reload
o Change math stuff from v3.Dot(v3) to Dot(v3, v3) style
o GUI
	o Basic immediate mode (send draw commands from all over the code. UI aggregate once per frame and draws)
	o Panels
	o Labels
	o Buttons
o Json scene loading
	o (De)Serializing scene data (mesh/object/material/light)
o Use quaternions instead of vec3 for rotation info
o Prefiltered cubemap for ambient specular
o Light aggregation work could be done at SceneUpdate instead of SceneRender
    - Also, could be done lazily only if light configuration changed, if not just send the same UBO
o Material Resources & Manager to avoid having duplicated materials and allow per-material sorting
o Visualisation for light sources
    o point lights (debug object)
    x area lights (real geometry)
o have the Makefile recompile if .h or .inl changed
